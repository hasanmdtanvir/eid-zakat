                <p>An individual can purify his heart and soul by paying zakat. Zakat cleanses a Muslim's soul from
                    being stingy, greedy and proud. By paying zakat, Muslims are able to develop a sense of sympathy
                    towards people in need. At the same time, it is able to eliminate selfishness.</p>

                <h1>What is Zakat in Islam?</h1>
                <p>Zakat is the third pillar of Islam and is a form of worship that involves wealth. However, it is
                    obligatory upon Muslims to pay a portion of his earnings once in a lunar (Hijra) year to the poor
                    and the needy when their earnings reach a prescribed amount (called “Nisab” ) above their needs.
                    Commanded to the Muslims in the second year of Hijra Allah (SWT) says in the Holy Qur’an:

                    “And establish regular Prayer and give Zakah, and bow down your heads with those who bow down (in
                    prayer).” (2:43)</p>

                <p>Zakah has to be paid once a year from the date a Muslim wealth equals or exceeds the Nisab. However,
                    only 2.5% of the wealth has to be donate to the eight categories of eligible recipients described in
                    the Holy Quran.

                    “Zakah expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect
                    [zakah] and for bringing hearts together [for Islam] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for
                    those in debt and the cause of Allah and the [stranded] traveler – an obligation [imposed] by Allah.
                    And Allah is Knowing and Wise.” (Al-Tawba: 60)</p>
